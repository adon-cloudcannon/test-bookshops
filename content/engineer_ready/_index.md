          What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror
          reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.

        title: We plant trees to counteract your printing's impact
        text: >-
          Forest Positive printing is extending the Forest Positive evolution
          into the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute
          to more trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper.
          Forest Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms
          essential business printing from a negative environmental footprint to
          a positive force for reforestation and ecological renewal.

          Some copy here about trees, climate change, deforestation, benefits of
          planting and/or similar. It shouldn’t be too long, as we expect this
          section to not be more than this amount of lines. But there’s room for
          a bit more. Maybe another line.
