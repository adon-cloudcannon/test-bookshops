          What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror
          reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.

        title: We plant trees to counteract your printing's impact
        text: >-
          <p><strong>Forest Positive printing</strong> is extending the Forest
          Positive evolution into the print space. It allows organisations to
          actively contribute to more trees being planted than those pulped into
          printing paper. Forest Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste
          and transforms essential business printing from a negative
          environmental footprint to a positive force for reforestation and
          ecological renewal.</p>

          <p>Some copy here about trees, climate change, deforestation, benefits
          of planting and/or similar. It shouldn’t be too long, as we expect
          this section to not be more than this amount of lines. But there’s
          room for a bit more. Maybe another line.</p>
