        Some copy here about trees, climate change, deforestation, benefits of
        planting and/or similar. It shouldn’t be too long, as we expect this
        section to not be more than this amount of lines. But there’s room for a
        bit more. Maybe another line.

      title: We plant trees to counteract your printing’s impact
      text: >-
        Forest Positive printing is extending the Forest Positive evolution into
        the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute to more
        trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper. Forest
        Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms essential
        business printing from a negative environmental footprint to a positive
        force for reforestation and ecological renewal.

        What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection
        of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.
