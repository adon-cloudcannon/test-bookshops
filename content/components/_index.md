            Forest Positive printing is extending the Forest Positive evolution into
            the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute to more
            trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper. Forest
            Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms essential
            business printing from a negative environmental footprint to a positive
            force for reforestation and ecological renewal.

            What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection
            of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.
